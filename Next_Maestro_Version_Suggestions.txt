# Suggestions for the Next Version of ResearchMaestro

## Key Features for Expansion
1. **Foster Collaborative Ecosystem**:
   - Develop a feature to log and display contributors.
   - Plan for Git integration when resources allow, enabling code sharing and version control.

2. **Enhance Modularity**:
   - Introduce task-specific cores for Echo:
     - Analytical Cores: Mathematical or logical tasks.
     - Experimental Cores: Hypothesis testing and simulations.
   - Add self-optimizing configurations for Echo's cores.

3. **Refine MachineAI**:
   - Focus on reasoning and lightweight implementations for tasks like optimization or numerical analysis.
   - Consider expanding MachineAI with formal logic solvers or theorem provers.

4. **Datasets for Learning**:
   - Curate and organize datasets for specific research objectives.
   - Ensure datasets enable Echo and MachineAI to generalize learning for broader applications.

5. **Ethical Framework**:
   - Track AI decisions and align them with ethical reasoning.
   - Ensure transparency and traceability of AI outcomes.

6. **Educational Modules**:
   - Develop content to teach the principles underpinning ResearchHarmonia.
   - Use modular design to align with users' learning needs and promote adoption.

These suggestions aim to broaden ResearchMaestroâ€™s capabilities while maintaining its modular and scalable design.
